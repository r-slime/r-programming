# r-programming
<br>
This is a repository of my work in r. I will update this README file with links to external examples of my work. <br>
<br>
<h2>Tutorials</h2>
The tutorial folder will have R tutorials within it that you can check out and maybe learn from me. These tutorials are downloaded notebooks from Kaggle, so you can use the copy and paste the links from the "links" document to see the tutorials and the code outputs. Feel free to leave feedback or questions via Kaggle.
