There are packages for: making complex functions easier, having more control over plots and their aesthetics, and even packages that contain datasets. When getting oriented with R you can get oriented with my favorite package the `tidyverse` package. This package is a collection of many packages that cover a range of needs from data cleaning to data visualization.  Below I will show you how to install and begin to use the  `tidyverse` . <br>\n<br>\nUsing the function `install.packages(\" \")` you can install your package of choice by inserting the name between the quotes. <br>\n> > Once you have the package installed you do not need to install it again. <br>\n>\n> After installing a package you will have to load it when you want to use it in a notebook, script, or project, and you do this with the `library()` function <br>\n> > Inserting the name between the parenthesis (also you do not use quotes when loading installed packages) <br>\n>\n> For installing and loading the `tidyverse` package, it should look like this:","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"install.packages(\"tidyverse\") # install the tidyverse package (only needs to be done once, and needs quotes)\nlibrary(tidyverse) # load the tidyverse package (needs to be done for each script, project, or notebook that will use this package, and does not need quotes)","metadata":{"_uuid":"051d70d956493feee0c6d64651c6a088724dca2a","_execution_state":"idle","execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-07-30T15:12:39.325367Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-07-30T15:12:39.326897Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-07-30T15:12:50.645833Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":17,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"> Installing and loading packages is not too hard, and if you get to the point where you have many packages to load for your analysis then you can even store the package names as a character vector using `c()` and load them all in at once with a function like below.  <br>\n<br>\n> Here is an example:","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"packages <- c(\"ggplot2\",\"tibble\",\"tidyr\",\"readr\",\"purrr\",\"dplyr\",\"stringr\",\"forcats\") # object \"packages\" contains each of these character strings which are seperated by commas and have quotes on either side\n# all of these packages above are actually included in the tidyverse package so just loading tidyverse will load all of them \n\ninvisible(lapply(packages, library, character.only = TRUE)) # make the output invisible -> lapply applies a function over a list or vector -> apply object \"packages\" to function library() -> when doing this, only read the characters ","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-07-30T15:12:50.649479Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-07-30T15:12:50.651058Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-07-30T15:12:50.682038Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":18,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Importing CSV Data\n> CSV files are very common data sources and easy to import into R.
